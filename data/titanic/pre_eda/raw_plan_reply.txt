Based on the information provided, here is a detailed plan for the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase. The plan is structured around specific tasks for each feature in the dataset, focusing on data exploration and initial insights.

### Task Plan for Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Task 1: Overview of the Dataset
**Objective**: Get a general understanding of the datasets to inform subsequent analysis.

- **Actions**:
  1. Load the train and test datasets using Pandas.
  2. Display the first few rows of each dataset to understand the structure.
  3. Use the `.info()` method to get a summary of each dataset, including the number of non-null entries and data types.
  4. Use the `.describe()` method to obtain basic statistics for numerical features.

- **Features Involved**: All features in both train and test datasets.

- **Tools**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Functions: `pd.read_csv()`, `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`

- **Expected Output**: 
  - A preview of the datasets (first few rows).
  - Summary information including data types and non-null counts.
  - Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.) for numerical features like Age, SibSp, Parch, and Fare.

- **Constraints**: Ensure the datasets are correctly loaded and handle any encoding issues.

#### Task 2: Missing Values Analysis
**Objective**: Identify and quantify missing values in the datasets to prepare for data cleaning.

- **Actions**:
  1. Use the `.isnull().sum()` method to calculate the number of missing values for each feature in both datasets.
  2. Visualize the missing data using a heatmap (if necessary) to show the presence of missing values.

- **Features Involved**: All features, with special focus on Age and Cabin, as these are likely to have missing values.

- **Tools**:
  - Pandas for missing value calculation.
  - Seaborn for heatmap visualization (if applicable).
  - Functions: `.isnull()`, `.sum()`, `sns.heatmap()`

- **Expected Output**: 
  - A list of features with their respective counts of missing values.
  - A heatmap visualization (if applicable) to illustrate the distribution of missing values.

- **Constraints**: Ensure the heatmap is efficient and clear; limit details to avoid clutter.

#### Task 3: Univariate Analysis of Key Features
**Objective**: Analyze the distribution and basic statistics of key features that may affect survival.

- **Actions**:
  1. Analyze the distribution of categorical features (Sex, Pclass, Embarked) using count plots.
  2. Analyze the distribution of numerical features (Age, Fare) using histograms or box plots.
  3. Calculate survival rates based on categorical features.

- **Features Involved**: 
  - Categorical: Sex, Pclass, Embarked
  - Numerical: Age, Fare

- **Tools**:
  - Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Seaborn or Matplotlib for visualizations.
  - Functions: `sns.countplot()`, `sns.histplot()`, `sns.boxplot()`

- **Expected Output**: 
  - Visualizations showing the distributions of key categorical and numerical features.
  - Summary statistics revealing survival rates segmented by gender, class, and embarkation port.

- **Constraints**: Limit visualizations to those that provide the most insight; avoid unnecessary complexity.

#### Task 4: Correlation Analysis
**Objective**: Explore relationships between numerical features and the target variable to identify potential indicators of survival.

- **Actions**:
  1. Compute the correlation matrix for numerical features using `.corr()`.
  2. Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to show correlations with the target variable (Survived).

- **Features Involved**: Numerical features (Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) and the target variable (Survived).

- **Tools**:
  - Pandas for correlation computation.
  - Seaborn for heatmap visualization.
  - Functions: `.corr()`, `sns.heatmap()`

- **Expected Output**: 
  - A correlation matrix highlighting the relationships between features and survival.
  - A heatmap visualization to illustrate the correlations clearly.

- **Constraints**: Ensure clarity in visual representation; focus on significant correlations.
