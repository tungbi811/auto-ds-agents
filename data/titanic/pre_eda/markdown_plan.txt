## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Overview of the Dataset
Tools, involved features and correct parameters: 
- Tools: Pandas
- Involved Features: All features in both train (train.csv) and test (test.csv) datasets
- Parameters: `pd.read_csv()`, `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`

Expected output or Impact on data: 
- Preview of datasets (first few rows)
- Summary information including data types and non-null counts
- Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.) for numerical features

Constraints: Ensure the datasets are correctly loaded and handle any encoding issues.

---

### STEP 2
Task: Missing Values Analysis
Tools, involved features and correct parameters: 
- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn
- Involved Features: All features, focusing on Age and Cabin
- Parameters: `.isnull().sum()`, `sns.heatmap()`

Expected output or Impact on data: 
- List of features with their respective counts of missing values
- Heatmap visualization (if applicable) to illustrate the distribution of missing values

Constraints: Ensure the heatmap is efficient and clear; limit details to avoid clutter.

---

### STEP 3
Task: Univariate Analysis of Key Features
Tools, involved features and correct parameters: 
- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Involved Features: 
  - Categorical: Sex, Pclass, Embarked
  - Numerical: Age, Fare
- Parameters: `sns.countplot()`, `sns.histplot()`, `sns.boxplot()`

Expected output or Impact on data: 
- Visualizations showing the distributions of key categorical and numerical features
- Summary statistics revealing survival rates segmented by gender, class, and embarkation port

Constraints: Limit visualizations to those that provide the most insight; avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

### STEP 4
Task: Correlation Analysis
Tools, involved features and correct parameters: 
- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn
- Involved Features: Numerical features (Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) and the target variable (Survived)
- Parameters: `.corr()`, `sns.heatmap()`

Expected output or Impact on data: 
- Correlation matrix highlighting the relationships between features and survival
- Heatmap visualization to illustrate the correlations clearly

Constraints: Ensure clarity in visual representation; focus on significant correlations.
