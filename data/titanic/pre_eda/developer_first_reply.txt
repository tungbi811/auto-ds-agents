Thank you for providing the necessary information. Based on the plan and given data, I will proceed to implement the tasks for Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Here's how I will structure the code and explanations for each task.

### TASK 1: Overview of the Dataset

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
In this step, I will load both the training and test datasets, display the first few rows, and provide summary information including data types and basic statistics for numerical features. This will help understand the structure and content of the datasets.

**CODE:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the training dataset
print("Training Data Preview:")
print(train_data.head())

# Summary information for the training dataset
print("\nTraining Data Info:")
print(train_data.info())

# Basic statistics for numerical features in the training dataset
print("\nTraining Data Description:")
print(train_data.describe())
```

**EXPLANATION:**
The code loads the training and test datasets using `pd.read_csv()`. It then displays the first few rows of the training dataset to provide a peek into the data. The `.info()` method gives a summary of the dataset, including data types and non-null counts, while `.describe()` provides basic statistics for numerical features, helping to identify the range and distribution of values.

### TASK 2: Missing Values Analysis

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
Next, I will analyze the missing values in both datasets. This is crucial for understanding which features may need imputation or removal. A heatmap will visually represent the distribution of missing values.

**CODE:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Count missing values in the training dataset
missing_train = train_data.isnull().sum()

# Display missing values
print("\nMissing Values in Training Data:")
print(missing_train[missing_train > 0])

# Visualize missing values using a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(train_data.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Values in Training Data')
plt.show()
```

**EXPLANATION:**
This code counts the missing values in the training dataset using `.isnull().sum()` and then filters to show only features with missing data. A heatmap is generated using Seaborn to visually illustrate the distribution of missing values across the dataset, making it easier to identify patterns.

### TASK 3: Univariate Analysis of Key Features

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
In this step, I will perform univariate analysis on key categorical and numerical features. This includes visualizations for the distributions of these features and survival rates segmented by gender, class, and embarkation port.

**CODE:**
```python
# Univariate analysis for categorical features
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))

# Sex distribution
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
sns.countplot(x='Sex', data=train_data)
plt.title('Distribution of Sex')

# Pclass distribution
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
sns.countplot(x='Pclass', data=train_data)
plt.title('Distribution of Passenger Class')

# Embarked distribution
plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
sns.countplot(x='Embarked', data=train_data)
plt.title('Distribution of Embarkation Port')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Univariate analysis for numerical features - Age and Fare
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))

# Age distribution
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.histplot(train_data['Age'].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Age Distribution')

# Fare distribution
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.histplot(train_data['Fare'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Fare Distribution')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Summary statistics for survival rates segmented by gender, class, and embarkation port
survival_stats = train_data.groupby(['Sex', 'Pclass', 'Embarked'])['Survived'].mean()
print("\nSurvival Rates by Sex, Class, and Embarked:")
print(survival_stats)
```

**EXPLANATION:**
This code performs univariate analysis by creating count plots for categorical features (Sex, Pclass, and Embarked) to show their distributions. It also plots histograms for the numerical features Age and Fare with kernel density estimates for better understanding of their distributions. Additionally, it calculates and prints the mean of the 'Survived' variable grouped by Sex, Pclass, and Embarked to reveal survival rates based on these factors.

### TASK 4: Correlation Analysis

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
Finally, I will analyze the correlation between numerical features and the target variable (Survived). This will help identify which features have the strongest relationships with survival outcomes.

**CODE:**
```python
# Correlation analysis
correlation_matrix = train_data.corr()

# Display the correlation matrix
print("\nCorrelation Matrix:")
print(correlation_matrix)

# Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

**EXPLANATION:**
The code computes the correlation matrix for the training dataset using `.corr()`, which shows the relationships between numerical features and the target variable, 'Survived'. A heatmap is generated for visual clarity, where annotations indicate the correlation coefficients, allowing for quick identification of strong correlations.

By executing this sequence of tasks, I will gather essential insights from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase, setting a solid foundation for the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.
