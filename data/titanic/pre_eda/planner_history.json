Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n### ID type\n- PassengerId\n\n### Numerical type\n- Age\n- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)\n- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)\n- Fare\n\n### Categorical type\n- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n- Pclass (Passenger class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)\n- Name\n- Sex\n- Ticket\n- Cabin\n- Embarked (Port of embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe dataset consists of information about passengers aboard the Titanic, with a total of 12 features in the training data and 11 in the test data. The target variable, 'Survived', indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). The dataset includes various demographic and ticketing details, such as:\n- **Age**: There are missing values in this feature, indicating some passengers' ages are not recorded.\n- **SibSp and Parch**: These features provide insights into family relationships aboard the ship. \n- **Fare**: Represents the ticket price, which varies significantly among passengers.\n- **Embarked**: The port of embarkation shows where passengers boarded the Titanic.\n\nThe dataset may reveal patterns regarding survival rates based on demographics, such as gender, age, and social class.\n\n## Target Variable\n- Survived: This binary variable indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). It is the main focus of the analysis to understand factors contributing to survival.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- PassengerId (int)\n- Survived (int: 0 or 1)\n\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Perform initial data exploration on both datasets.\n2. Identify basic statistics, data types, and distributions.\n3. Detect potential issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.\n4. Provide insights to guide the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.\n\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"
