To correct the error in the code snippet, we need to address the `FileNotFoundError`. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. **Analyze the Error**: The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError`, which means that the file path provided to `pd.read_csv()` does not exist. The path `'/path/to/dataset/train.csv'` is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the correct path to the CSV file.

2. **Correct the Error**: To fix the error, we need to specify the correct file path where the `train.csv` file is located. If you know the correct path, replace the placeholder with that path.

3. **Corrected Code Snippet**: Assuming the file `train.csv` is located in a directory named `data` within the current working directory, the corrected path might look like `'./data/train.csv'`. Adjust the path based on your actual directory structure.

Here's the corrected code snippet:

```python
train_data = pd.read_csv('./data/train.csv')
```

Make sure to replace `'./data/train.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file.
