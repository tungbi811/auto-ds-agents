Then check out\u00a0[Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial)\u00a0that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered \u201cunsinkable\u201d RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> \n> We highly recommend\u00a0[Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial)\u00a0that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and\u00a0[this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests)\u00a0to get started.\n\n## Overview of How Kaggle\u2019s Competitions Work\n\n1. **Join the Competition**  \n    Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n2. **Get to Work**  \n    Download the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n3. **Make a Submission**  \n    Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n4. **Check the Leaderboard**  \n    See how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.\n5. **Improve Your Score**  \n    Check out the\u00a0[discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion)\u00a0to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> \n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out Dr. Rachael Tatman\u2019s\u00a0[video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s)\u00a0to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled\u00a0`train.csv`\u00a0and the other is titled\u00a0`test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv`\u00a0will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d.\n\nThe\u00a0`test.csv`\u00a0dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the \u201cground truth\u201d for each passenger. It\u2019s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the\u00a0`train.csv`\u00a0data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in\u00a0`test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the\u00a0[\u201cData\u201d tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\u00a0to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you\u2019ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the \u201cSubmit Predictions\u201d button  \n    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png)\n2. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You\u2019re able to submit 10 submissions a day.  \n    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png)\n\n## Submission File Format:\n\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond\u00a0`PassengerId`\u00a0and\u00a0`Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n\n- `PassengerId`\u00a0(sorted in any order)\n- `Survived`\u00a0(contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I\u2019m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n\n- For Competition Help:\u00a0[Titanic Discussion Forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion)\n- Technical Help:\u00a0[Kaggle Contact Us Page](https://www.kaggle.com/contact)\n\nKaggle doesn\u2019t have a dedicated support team so you\u2019ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\n\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.\n\nIn every competition, you\u2019ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights.

This is known as\u00a0[accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification).\n\n## Submission File Format\n\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries\u00a0**plus**\u00a0a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.  \n  \nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n\n- PassengerId (sorted in any order)\n- Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n**PassengerId,Survived**  \n892,0  \n893,1  \n894,0  \nEtc.\n\nYou can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the\u00a0[Data page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n## What is a Getting Started competition?\n\nGetting Started competitions were created by Kaggle data scientists for people who have little to no machine learning background. They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.\n\nGetting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle\u2019s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.\n\n## How do I create and manage a team?\n\nWhen you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More >\u00a0[Team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team)\u00a0page.\n\nWe've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the\u00a0[discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\n\n## What are Notebooks?\n\nKaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the\u00a0[Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks)\u00a0tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our\u00a0[Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)!\n\n## Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?\n\nTo keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.\n\nIf your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.\n\n_\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"_\u00a0Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard\u00a0[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240).\n\n## How do I contact Support?\n\nKaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you\u2019ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you\u2019ll want to use the\u00a0[Titanic discussion forum)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\n\nSupport is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can\u2019t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\nIf your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please\u00a0[contact us](https://www.kaggle.com/contact).\n\n### Citation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nWill Cukierski.

Competition Overview\nThe Titanic competition is a beginner-friendly challenge on Kaggle aimed at helping participants learn basic machine learning concepts. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on various passenger features.\n\n## 2. Files\n- **train.csv**: Contains data for 891 passengers, including the target variable \"Survived\" (0 for not survived, 1 for survived).\n- **test.csv**: Contains data for 418 passengers without the \"Survived\" variable, used for making predictions.\n- **sample_submission.csv**: An example format for the submission file.\n\n## 3. Problem Definition\nThe problem is to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on available features such as age, gender, and socio-economic status. Participants will create a model using the training data and apply it to the test data to predict survival outcomes.\n\n## 4. Data Information\n### 4.1 Data type\n#### 4.1.1 ID type\n- PassengerId\n\n#### 4.1.2 Numerical type\n- Age\n- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)\n- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)\n- Fare\n\n#### 4.1.3 Categorical type\n- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n- Pclass (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)\n- Name\n- Sex (male, female)\n- Ticket\n- Cabin\n- Embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n\n#### 4.1.4 Datetime type\n- None\n\n### 4.2 Detailed data description\nThe training dataset contains 12 features, while the test dataset has 11 features (excluding the survival outcome). Key characteristics include a binary outcome for survival, socio-economic indicators, gender differentiation, and significant variation in the fare.\n\n## 5. Target Variable\nThe target variable is **Survived**, indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the Titanic disaster.\n\n## 6. Evaluation Metrics\nThe evaluation metric is **accuracy**, which measures the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions made.\n\n## 7. Submission Format\nThe submission file must be in CSV format with exactly two columns:\n- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for passengers (sorted in any order).\n- **Survived**: Binary predictions (0 for not survived, 1 for survived).\n\nExample format:\n```\nPassengerId,Survived\n892,0\n893,1\n894,0\n...\n```\n\n## 8. Other Key Aspects\n- The competition is open-ended with a rolling leaderboard that resets every two months, encouraging continuous improvement.\n- Participants are encouraged to engage with the community through discussion forums and shared notebooks.\n- Feature engineering can enhance model performance, and various modeling techniques should be explored.\n```\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
