## Detailed data description
The dataset consists of two parts: training data and test data. The training data contains 10 records with 12 features, while the test data includes 10 records with 11 features (without the target variable 'Survived'). 

### Notable Patterns and Characteristics:
- The 'Survived' column is binary, indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).
- The 'Pclass' feature shows three distinct classes, with 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest.
- The 'Sex' feature categorizes passengers as either male or female.
- The 'Age' feature contains both integer and float types, with some missing values in the training data.
- The 'Fare' feature varies significantly, with the highest fare in the training data being 71.2833.
- The 'Embarked' feature indicates the port from which passengers boarded, with 'S' (Southampton) being the most common.

## Target Variable
- The target variable is 'Survived', indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the Titanic disaster.
