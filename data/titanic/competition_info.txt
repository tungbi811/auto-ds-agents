# Competition Information
## 1. Competition Overview
The Titanic competition is a beginner-friendly challenge on Kaggle aimed at helping participants learn basic machine learning concepts. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on various passenger features.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: Contains data for 891 passengers, including the target variable "Survived" (0 for not survived, 1 for survived).
- **test.csv**: Contains data for 418 passengers without the "Survived" variable, used for making predictions.
- **sample_submission.csv**: An example format for the submission file.

## 3. Problem Definition
The problem is to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on available features such as age, gender, and socio-economic status. Participants will create a model using the training data and apply it to the test data to predict survival outcomes.

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- PassengerId

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Fare

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
- Name
- Sex (male, female)
- Ticket
- Cabin
- Embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

#### 4.1.4 Datetime type
- None

### 4.2 Detailed data description
The training dataset contains 12 features, while the test dataset has 11 features (excluding the survival outcome). Key characteristics include a binary outcome for survival, socio-economic indicators, gender differentiation, and significant variation in the fare.

## 5. Target Variable
The target variable is **Survived**, indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the Titanic disaster.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metric is **accuracy**, which measures the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions made.

## 7. Submission Format
The submission file must be in CSV format with exactly two columns:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for passengers (sorted in any order).
- **Survived**: Binary predictions (0 for not survived, 1 for survived).

Example format:
```
PassengerId,Survived
892,0
893,1
894,0
...
```

## 8. Other Key Aspects
- The competition is open-ended with a rolling leaderboard that resets every two months, encouraging continuous improvement.
- Participants are encouraged to engage with the community through discussion forums and shared notebooks.
- Feature engineering can enhance model performance, and various modeling techniques should be explored.
